# Love2D-ECS-System
A proof-of-concept for an Entity Component System styled approach at a more user-friendly extension of the Love2D software. An example can be found in the main.lua file, although it is very fundamental.

Featuring in-built:
- Layers
- Events/Connections
- ECS-style component support
- Shape and image rendering
- Fundamental collider and physics body components
- Easy to use Camera and coordinate tools

Created over the span of a few days in an IT classroom.
